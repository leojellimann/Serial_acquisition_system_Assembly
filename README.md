# Serial_acquisition_system_Assembly
You probably wonder how is it possible to communicate between a microcontroller and a serial port of your computer in assembly language ?

Well, this was my project of assembly class during my second year in computer science engineering school

In this program, I first built a serial acquisiton system to communicate between my microcontroller and serial port on my computer.
The purpose of that ?
Reading the voltage coming from a card linked to the microcontroller and displaying it the PuTTY terminal.

In order to do that, I first had to set up a serial USART communication with PuTTY terminal.
Once that done, I had to convert the voltage value from byte to ascii language to understand easily the reading value.

After that, I was able to display the voltage read on the terminal but with a pretty high frequency.
Finally, in order to keep my terminal clear, I regulated the display frequency on the terminal.

Sorry for not having any output of what this program does but I don't have the necessary devices to build/compile it.

You can find attached the report detailing my entire program and how it works.

Enjoy :)
